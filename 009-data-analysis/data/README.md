Expenditure Data Example
========================

The data file in this directory, expenditure.xls, is taken
from the UK's open data project: [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/social_trends).

It has been provided by the Office for National Statistics
under the [Open Government License](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

Ideally, we would have picked some data from the excellent OpenDataNI
project, who presented here last week, but they have taken the progressive
step of mandating standardized formats for all their public sector
data contributions, so have no Excel files!
